This is a Java starter project that can be cloned for Hash Code challenge, in order to have a ready-to-use Java project.

The input files are placed in `src\main\resources\input` folder and the output files will be generated in the root folder; in order to select which input file will be treated, the variables `INPUT_FILENAME` and `OUTPUT_FILENAME` in `Constants` class must change accordingly.

Please note that this project contains the Gradle wrapper `gradlew`; this means that you can type `./gradlew build` to execute the build task without installing Gradle on your machine.
For any other information about Gradle wrapper please follow the [official documentation](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) from Gradle.
